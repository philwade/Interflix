Interflix is an android app for managing Netflix queues. It is currently available on the android market: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.philwade.android.interflix

At the moment it is quite buggy because of Netflix API changes. Pull requests welcome.

Branch to test api fixes.
Test.
